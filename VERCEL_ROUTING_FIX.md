# üöÄ Vercel SPA Routing Fix for Payment Callbacks

## Problem Identified
The route `/payments/callback/success` works locally but shows **"not found"** in production on Vercel. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) deployed on Vercel.

## Root Cause
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server automatically handles client-side routing
- **Production**: Vercel tries to find `/payments/callback/success` as a static file, which doesn't exist
- **Solution Needed**: Configure Vercel to serve `index.html` for all client-side routes

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added `vercel.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    { 
      "source": "/((?!api/).*)", 
      "destination": "/index.html" 
    }
  ]
}
```
**What this does**: Rewrites all non-API routes to serve `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle the routing.

### 2. Added `_redirects` File
**File**: `frontend/public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
**Purpose**: Backup SPA routing configuration (Netlify-style, but also works on some platforms).

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration
**File**: `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- Added proper build optimization
- Set base path to root (`/`)
- Configured manual chunks for better caching

### 4. Created Test Page
**URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/routing-test.html`
- Static test page to verify routing works
- Direct links to test callback routes

## üß™ How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy (if connected) or manually deploy

### Step 2: Test the Problematic URL
Your original failing URL should now work:
```
https://edviron-assignment-ten.vercel.app/payments/callback/success?EdvironCollectRequestId=68cc56f5154d1bce65b55f9a&status=SUCCESS
```

### Step 3: Test Routes Directly
- ‚úÖ `https://yourdomain.com/payments/callback/success`
- ‚úÖ `https://yourdomain.com/payments/callback/failure`  
- ‚úÖ `https://yourdomain.com/payments/callback/debug`
- ‚úÖ `https://yourdomain.com/payments/callback/tester`

### Step 4: Use Test Page
Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/routing-test.html`
- Static HTML page that will always work
- Contains test links to all callback routes
- Shows current URL information

## üîç Debug Your Issue

### If Routes Still Don't Work:

1. **Check Vercel Deployment Logs**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Functions tab
   - Look for any build errors

2. **Verify Build Output**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ls dist/  # Should contain index.html and assets
   ```

3. **Test Locally with Preview**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   Then test: `http://localhost:4173/payments/callback/success`

4. **Check Network Tab**
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Visit the failing URL
   - Check if it returns 404 or serves index.html

### Alternative Deployment Approach
If the above doesn't work, try this alternative `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "frontend/dist/index.html": {
      "includeFiles": "frontend/dist/**"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` created with SPA routing
- ‚úÖ `_redirects` file added as backup
- ‚úÖ `vite.config.ts` updated with proper base path
- ‚úÖ Test page created for verification
- ‚úÖ All callback routes configured in React Router
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Push changes to trigger Vercel deployment
2. **Test**: Verify the problematic URL now works
3. **Monitor**: Check Vercel function logs for any issues
4. **Verify**: Test all payment callback scenarios

The fix addresses the core SPA routing issue and should resolve your "not found" error in production!

## üÜò Emergency Fallback
If the SPA routing fix doesn't work immediately, you can use the callback handler route:
```
https://edviron-assignment-ten.vercel.app/payments/callback/handler?EdvironCollectRequestId=68cc56f5154d1bce65b55f9a&status=SUCCESS
```
This route will automatically redirect to the correct success/failure page.
